        This project will be about making the 3D catalog of the library whcihb includes to make the search engine on the librayr. So here the user might enter the website and search for a book in the library exact location of the book in the racks of library. And this will include me to use three js and javascripot again. I may dive into database managament and see if I can use SQL to make the website more faster.

        Interactive 3D Book Locator for P. K. Kelkar Library, IIT Kanpur
        The Red Shelf is a web-based library navigation system designed to help users quickly locate physical books inside the large and complex layout of the P. K. Kelkar Library. Instead of relying only on shelf codes or floor numbers, the system provides a visual, spatial wayfinding experience using an interactive 3D model of the library.
        Users search for a book by title, author, or identifier through a simple search interface. The backend queries catalog data and maps the book to its corresponding physical bookshelf. The frontend then displays a 3D model of the library, where the target bookshelf is dynamically highlighted in red, allowing users to visually understand the exact location of the book. This makes physical navigation faster, especially for new users and large collections.
        The system is built using Three.js for real-time 3D visualization and Blender for modeling the library layout and shelves. A Node.js + Express backend handles search requests and data flow, while PostgreSQL is used to maintain a relational mapping between books and their physical shelf locations. The project is designed to integrate with the institute’s existing library catalog infrastructure and is optimized for use on mobile devices as well as desktops.
        The Red Shelf focuses on clarity, usability, and performance rather than visual excess, ensuring that the experience remains lightweight and accessible. The project demonstrates the application of full-stack web development, database design, and 3D visualization to solve a real, campus-scale problem and is intended to be handed over as a functional tool for institutional use.

    <h2>Phases of this project</h2>
    <p>
        This project will be excuted in three phases. And they are as follows:<br>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Modelling: </b>I will have to build the model of this library, an dfor this I will first take many pictures of my own library. After whcih i will make the model in bledner. I will also take the pictures of my shelfs and there IDs. Names of the model in blender has to given carefully. FOr this phases I am giving myself three days. One day to get the refrences and setting up the idea, and the rest two days to model the whole library. This is schedules to be executed on 16th January to 18th January.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Front-End</b> : This will not be the for the first time that i will be used thre js to make this. The Front-End of the website will be kept minimal. I will add the search bar where I will be aksing for the ID of each book. And thats it. So all that the front end will contain is the <b>Search bar</b>, and <b>Library model</b>, and also space for the title of this project. Along with the footer with links to this documentation, code, and also link to my personal website, damn it!
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Back-End : </b>This will be the tough part. The backend will be made in <b>node.js</b> and also <b>PostgreSQl</b>. node js tp send the query to databse, and PostgreSQl to retrieve the data from the database. This will be my first expereice with Database.
                <br>
                Once the location of the bookshelf is retirved, I will remove the search bar, make the library's opacity very low, and the bookshelf inside it will be made to appear somewhat dim, and then the bookshelf where you would find the book will be turned <b>Red</b>. Hence the name Red Shelf.
            </li>
        </ol>

        I have just now came taking some pictures of the library. And the link to all the pictures of library is given below. And after seeing the library closely, which I haven't done even though I have visited it multiple times, I see that it's architecture is magnificent. The complexity, and unsymmetricity in the design make me wonder how could some one even imagine this. The architect of our library is <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achyut_Kanvinde"><b>Achyut Kanvinde</b></a>. I don't have words to describe how great his work is. Truly Amaaazing work and an Amaaazing Architect! I have linked all the downloadable pictures of the library that I will be using as reference, below.<br>

    </p>
    <p>
        From tommorrow onwards, I will start modelling the library. So the plan it to make the model as low poly as possilbe, and visit the library later on perfecting the model with small details. But I dont aim to have a perfect model ready by tomorrow.

        Ok so today, I got wasted. I am feeling very low from the start of this day. nothing seems to be working out. I am feeling very low. This might be the lowest poitn in my life. But I don't want to make this documentation a personal diary. So I will meet you tomorrow. And whether or not I start modelling will depend on my mood tomorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ok so i tried makign the librayr and i have got everythig write, and as soon as the adrenaline rushed, my file got deleted due to blender crashing. I got fucked up. This was very annoying. Hours of work got deleted instantly. I have alomost completely made the complete outer part of the library before it fucked me.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ok so i put some more time and made the model again. Now here are the result. As i proceed with the modeling, it becomes more and kore easier, and more and more interetsiung. I hav emade more than i wnat i have expecetd.
        Here are the images<br>

        I am completely satiosfed by todays work. ki have successfully made almost entire exterioir of our librayr, and now is the time when oi will be building the interiori, since that is why this applicatuion will be used. So today, i have completeed the exterior except for the handles for stairs and the stair case at the other side of ther librayr. And apart from that everythign is done. Along with the first implmentation of three js. So wiht that. i will show some of the results that i have done today. I have also added an opening animation to make it look good. But haven't added the search bar, and the footer. Will be adding that in the next schedule.

        So today, that I have completely made the model, and it's website, next week, I will work no perfecting the model, and also working on the front end. So the task that is left is to make the frontend, which includes making the search bar, and the footer. And also fixing the animation of openign page of the website. And then the most important part is to name the shelfs of the website, and then one thing I am thinking to do, is use <b>gsap</b>, and make the user experince the interior of the librayr too. And this will, give them a imersive experince to travel to the bookshelf. I will make the interior as minimal as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
        So here is the flow. THe user will click a start button and then he will see the website starting along with the animation. And then he will see the search bar. Where he will put the id of the book. And then after the phase three of the project is compelted, the user will see the bookshelf of that book trunign red. So after that the user has option to use the gsap method,a nd actually travel along the the path througbt he interioir to get to the bookshelf. And once he clicks the first "flag" he will be locked in the positon of camera, but he can rotate. And then he will click the next flag, and liek wise he can travel to the bookshelf. So when he is locked in the gasp, he will be allowed to go back to the normal view (Global oRibital), and during the gspa mode, he will not be able to change the location of camera. only the rotation. This will not allow the user to move into the mesh.
